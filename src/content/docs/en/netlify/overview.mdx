Netlify is a hosting service that makes it easy to deploy static and dynamic sites. It integrates with repositories like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, automatically building and deploying whenever code changes are pushed. Netlify's powerful features include custom domain settings, automatic SSL certificate generation, form handling, and support for serverless functions. Additionally, by using the preview feature, you can check the deployed site for each pull request, making team collaboration easier. By using Netlify, developers can quickly publish websites without being bothered by infrastructure management.

## About Plans

There are three plans available. You can check the details on the official website.

Netlify acquired the static site generator tool Gatsby in 2023. They are promoting it as a good combination with static hosting services. Of course, it is possible to deploy other frameworks, but some cases may require plugins.

6. Specify the repository designated on the previous screen.

   ![Select repository](../../../../assets/netlify/overview09.png)

7. Proceed with the project settings

   ![Let’s deploy your project with…](../../../../assets/netlify/overview10.png)

   Set the following items here:

   - `Site name`: The name of the site, used as a subdomain of netlify.app
   - `Branch to deploy`: You can select the branch name of the specified repository
   - `Base directory`: Not necessary if running at the root
   - `Build command`: The command to execute when building. Example: `npm run build`
   - `Publish directory`: The deployment destination of the built data. Example: `dist`
   - `Functions directory`: Specify the directory if using functions
   - `Environment variables`: Apply any environment variables needed when building

   Click the Deploy button at the bottom of the screen. The build will be executed for a while.

8. When the deployment is complete, a Success screen will appear.

   ![Site deploy in progress](../../../../assets/netlify/overview12.png)

</Steps>

When the site is launched, a settings screen for this project will be provided as shown below.

## Add Subdomain

If you want to assign a custom domain to the launched site, you can proceed with the following steps.

<Steps>

1. Click `Domain management` in the project menu.

2. Click the `Add a domain` button to start the domain addition process.

   ![Add a domain](../../../../assets/netlify/overview14.png)

3. Set the domain you want to add.

   ![Verify domain](../../../../assets/netlify/overview15.png)

4. Once the domain is verified, the screen will switch to add the domain.

   ![Add subdomain](../../../../assets/netlify/overview16.png)

5. The screen will switch to confirm the work on the external DNS.

   ![Awaiting External DNS](../../../../assets/netlify/overview17.png)

   Click Awaiting External DNS to display the information to be set in the DNS.

6. After a while, the DNS settings will be reflected, and you will be able to access the site.

   ![Primary domain](../../../../assets/netlify/overview19.png)

</Steps>

This time, we were able to apply a subdomain.

## Summary

This time, we confirmed the steps to deploy this documentation site to Netlify. Since this site itself is a static site based on Astro, there were no particular sticking points, but if server-side rendering or other processing is required, separate steps will be needed.
